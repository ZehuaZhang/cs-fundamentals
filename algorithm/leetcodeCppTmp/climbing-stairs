70. Climbing Stairs
Difficulty: Easy

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int prev = 0, curr = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        	int nextPrev = curr;
        	curr += prev;
        	prev = nextPrev;
        }
        return curr;
    }
};
