// 274. H-Index
// Difficulty: Medium

// Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
// write a function to compute the researcher h-index.

// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
// "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
// and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

// For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and
// each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
// Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and
// the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

// Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

// Hint:
// An easy approach is to sort the array first.
// What are the possible values of h-index?
// A faster approach is to use extra space.

// Time:  O(n)
// Space: O(n)
